# GNSS Status

GNSS Status consists of two parts: a C# sensor application designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, and the GNSS Status web UI.

The C# application collects and parses NMEA0183 sentences from a GNSS sensor and parses ionospheric data from an image. The parsed data is then sent to an MQTT server for storage. The GNSS Status web UI retrieves the data from the MQTT server and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **NMEA0183 Sentence Parsing**: Collects and parses various NMEA0183 sentences such as GGA, GSA, GST, GSV, and NTR.
- **Ionospheric Data Parsing**: Extracts ionospheric data from the [FINPOS Iono image](https://finpos.nls.fi/iono/) provided by the National Land Survey of Finland to calculate the ionospheric percentage.
- **MQTT Integration**: Sends the parsed GNSS and ionospheric data to an MQTT server for further processing and storage.
- **Configuration Management**: Uses a configuration manager to handle various settings such as server addresses, ports, and intervals.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi
- GNSS Sensor
- .NET 7.0 SDK
- MQTT Server

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GNSSStatus.git
    cd GNSSStatus
    ```

2. **Install .NET 7.0 SDK**:
   Follow the instructions on the [.NET 7.0 SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) to install the SDK on your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Build the project**:
    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

## Configuration

The application uses a configuration file to manage settings. An `assets/config.json` file is autogenerated on first start to the directory. Ensure it is correctly configured with your GNSS sensor details, MQTT server details, and other relevant settings.

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will continuously collect and parse data from the GNSS sensor and ionospheric image. The parsed data will be sent to the configured MQTT server, where it can be displayed on a website.
